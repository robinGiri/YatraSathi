# YatraSathi

Yatra Sathi is aimed at developing a comprehensive platform that enables customers to easily register, rent and return vehicles. It offers the possibility for other users to hire cars, generating income for the platform in the process.
Users would be able to select from a number of car classifications, pick-up and drop-off locations, and examine the availability of the desired vehicle as part of the system's customer registration procedure. Additionally, the network would include a royalty and festival discount system, which would reward loyal clients and offer special deals on occasion.
